## Setting the stage

Pathfinder connects local experts with travelers seeking curated adventures. The
concept resonated with groups, yet multi-person bookings broke down once travelers hit
the checkout flow. I joined as the embedded design lead for a 12-week sprint to ship an
MVP before peak travel season.

We set three goals:

- Increase the percentage of trip inquiries that converted to paid bookings.
- Reduce back-and-forth emails between travelers and hosts.
- Capture traveler preferences in a way that honored accessibility and dietary needs.

## Research in motion

I interviewed 18 travelers and 9 hosts, then mapped a service blueprint to identify the
moments where the experience frayed. The biggest signal: group leaders were acting as
human routers — coordinating passports, payments, and preferences across a mess of
channels.

We prototyped concepts that made collaboration feel like planning together in the same
room. Key flows were validated with 42 travelers using moderated sessions run in Lookback
with both desktop and mobile participants.

## Experience highlights

### Cohesive itinerary planning

Groups could invite travelers via shareable links. Everyone had a dedicated profile to
add passport details, dietary needs, and activity preferences. Color-coded status chips
made it obvious who still needed to complete what.

### Flexible payments

Travelers could pay individually, split balances, or gift portions of the trip. Stripe’s
API gave us guardrails while still accommodating deposits. We surfaced transparent
refund policies before payment to build trust.

### Accessibility woven in

Hosts now receive a summarized accessibility brief that highlights mobility needs,
communication preferences, and dietary restrictions. This made it easier to prepare
inclusive itineraries and sparked better conversations with guests.

## Results

- Booking completion rate jumped **33%** within the first month of launch.
- Support emails about “how do I add another traveler?” dropped by **68%**.
- Hosts report saving an average of **4 hours** per trip on coordination tasks.

Pathfinder has since scaled to serve corporate retreats and university travel programs
using the same foundations we built for consumer groups.
