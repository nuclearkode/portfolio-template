## Why we tackled Atlas

Atlas is a mission-critical analytics tool used by 6,000+ operations managers. Years of
feature requests layered on top of each other until the interface became an archeology
project. Teams filed tickets daily just to find the metrics they needed.

As design lead I partnered with product, data science, and a tiger team of engineers to
modernize the experience without breaking established workflows.

## From entropy to clarity

- **Data taxonomy workshops** — We ran cross-functional sessions to align on the naming,
  grouping, and prioritization of metrics. This fed into a revised information
  architecture that cut the primary navigation from 9 items to 4.
- **Component audit** — 162 chart variations were reduced to 8 canonical components,
  each with clearly documented usage guidance and accessibility annotations.
- **Progressive disclosure** — We introduced contextual drill-ins and filters to reduce
  cognitive load. Teams can still dive deep when needed, but the default view now tells a
  coherent story.

## Scaling through systems

I created a unified design token library powering both Figma and the React component
library. We paired designers with engineers to refactor legacy views incrementally, using
feature flags to de-risk releases. Weekly office hours kept stakeholders aligned and
surfaced adoption wins.

## Impact

- Support tickets tied to “dashboard confusion” fell by **48%** in the first quarter.
- Average task completion time for key workflows improved by **37%** in usability tests.
- The platform earned internal NPS +42, up from -3 before we began.

Atlas now ships new analytics modules twice as fast because teams have a shared language
for how data should show up. That’s the power of pairing systems thinking with pragmatic
delivery.
