I built the **design leadership scorecard** as a quick gut-check when juggling multiple
product surfaces. It’s a tool for understanding where to focus your energy, especially if
you’re leading a small but mighty team.

## The pillars

1. **Clarity of vision** — Does everyone know what good looks like?
2. **Team health** — Are designers supported, growing, and collaborating well?
3. **Design quality** — Do shipped experiences reflect our standards?
4. **Operational excellence** — Are workflows humming or grinding?

Each pillar gets a rating from 1-5 with a few sentences explaining the score. I run the
exercise solo, then validate with peers to catch blind spots.

> **Pro tip:** Pair the scorecard with qualitative feedback from partners. Numbers are a
> prompt, not a verdict.

## Using the insights

- **Score of 1-2** — Triage mode. Pick one pillar to stabilize before moving on.
- **Score of 3** — Plateau. Identify rituals that need reinforcement.
- **Score of 4-5** — Momentum! Capture the practices working well and codify them.

Review quarterly, compare trends, and share a summary with your leadership partners. The
scorecard keeps conversations grounded in outcomes instead of opinions.
