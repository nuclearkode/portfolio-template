        <p>
                I’m Ahmed, a platform and full-stack engineer who specializes in complex, high-signal systems.
                For more than a decade I’ve helped teams launch telemetry platforms, robotics stacks, and
                developer infrastructure that stay stable long after the first release.
        </p>

        <p>
                My work sits at the intersection of architecture, delivery, and enablement. I map the ecosystem around
                a challenge, prototype the riskiest paths, and bring cross-functional partners along with clear RFCs and
                instrumentation. The goal is always the same: shipping dependable software while keeping humans in the
                loop.
        </p>

        <p>
                I’ve led platform guilds, embedded with mission control teams, and stood up DX practices that serve
                dozens of product squads. Whether I’m pair-programming Rust services, sketching observability workflows,
                or coaching engineers through incident retros, I keep the focus on measurable outcomes.
        </p>

        <p>
                Outside of project work, I contribute to open-source infrastructure tooling, mentor emerging engineers,
                and co-organize a local reliability meetup. When I’m not in the command center you’ll probably find me
                trail running in the Cascades or tinkering with custom mechanical keyboards.
