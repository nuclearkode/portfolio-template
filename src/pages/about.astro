                I’m Jordan Mitchell, a product designer with 12+ years of experience helping teams translate
                customer insight into digital products. I’ve shipped everything from consumer finance apps to
                enterprise AI dashboards, always guided by measurable outcomes and a bias toward inclusive
                research.
        </p>

        <p>
                My practice blends storytelling, facilitation, and systems thinking. I love the messy middle of
                shaping vision and the quiet craft of implementation. You’ll often find me sketching scenarios,
                auditing flows with engineers, or synthesizing research to spotlight the human stories behind the
                data.
        </p>

        <p>
                Over the years I’ve led design teams, coached emerging designers, and partnered with founders
                navigating pivotal inflection points. Across every engagement I hold space for collaboration,
                encourage healthy critique, and make sure decisions leave a trail others can follow.
        </p>

        <p>
                I believe that inclusive design is simply good design. Outside of project work I mentor through
                Hexagon UX, co-host a local accessibility meetup, and speak on building sustainable design
                practices. When I’m not behind a screen, you can find me trail running in Forest Park or experimenting
                with analog photography.

                craft along the way — I’d love to talk. <a href="mailto:hello@jordanmitchell.design">Reach out</a> or
