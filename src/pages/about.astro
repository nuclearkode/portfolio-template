                I’m Ahmed, a platform and full-stack engineer who specializes in complex, high-signal systems.
                For more than a decade I’ve helped teams launch telemetry platforms, robotics stacks, and
                developer infrastructure that stay stable long after the first release.
        </p>

        <p>
                My work sits at the intersection of architecture, delivery, and enablement. I map the ecosystem around
                a challenge, prototype the riskiest paths, and bring cross-functional partners along with clear RFCs and
                instrumentation. The goal is always the same: shipping dependable software while keeping humans in the
                loop.
        </p>

        <p>
                I’ve led platform guilds, embedded with mission control teams, and stood up DX practices that serve
                dozens of product squads. Whether I’m pair-programming Rust services, sketching observability workflows,
                or coaching engineers through incident retros, I keep the focus on measurable outcomes.
        </p>

        <p>
                Outside of project work, I contribute to open-source infrastructure tooling, mentor emerging engineers,
                and co-organize a local reliability meetup. When I’m not in the command center you’ll probably find me
                trail running in the Cascades or tinkering with custom mechanical keyboards.
        </p>

        <p>
                If you’re steering an ambitious build and need a partner who can balance velocity with reliability,
                let’s talk. <a href="mailto:hello@ahmed.dev">Reach out</a> or connect on
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmed-engineer" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
                I’m Jordan Mitchell, a product designer with 12+ years of experience helping teams translate
                customer insight into digital products. I’ve shipped everything from consumer finance apps to
                enterprise AI dashboards, always guided by measurable outcomes and a bias toward inclusive
                research.
        </p>

        <p>
                My practice blends storytelling, facilitation, and systems thinking. I love the messy middle of
                shaping vision and the quiet craft of implementation. You’ll often find me sketching scenarios,
                auditing flows with engineers, or synthesizing research to spotlight the human stories behind the
                data.
        </p>

        <p>
                Over the years I’ve led design teams, coached emerging designers, and partnered with founders
                navigating pivotal inflection points. Across every engagement I hold space for collaboration,
                encourage healthy critique, and make sure decisions leave a trail others can follow.
        </p>

        <p>
                I believe that inclusive design is simply good design. Outside of project work I mentor through
                Hexagon UX, co-host a local accessibility meetup, and speak on building sustainable design
                practices. When I’m not behind a screen, you can find me trail running in Forest Park or experimenting
                with analog photography.
        </p>

        <p>
                If you’re looking for a partner who can help your team move from idea to launch — while elevating the
                craft along the way — I’d love to talk. <a href="mailto:hello@jordanmitchell.design">Reach out</a> or
                connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanmitchell" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
